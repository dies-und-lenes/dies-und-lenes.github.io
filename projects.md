# DBpedia Live
I implemented a new [EventStreams](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Event_Platform/EventStreams) client for the live module of the [DBpedia extraction framework](https://github.com/dies-und-lenes/extraction-framework/tree/master/live). I also adapted it to support abstract extraction in multiple languages. 
# REST API for DBpedia
I was project manager and developer of the [REST API for DBpedia](https://github.com/dbpedia/ontology-driven-api) as part of a students project in 2017.
